Absorbing and entertaining, this book lends bu siness people a wealth of ideas on the \\nsubtle art of playing the power game, exercising clever cunning, and understanding human \\nweaknesses. Whether it is in the boardroom, at a power lunch, or a cocktail party – these laws will \\nmake you master of the game a nd give you the edge over your rivals.  \\n  \\n1. NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER.  \\n• Transgression of the Law.  \\nThe 48 Laws Of Power    Page 2  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  Finance Minister Fouquet unintentionally outshone his master, King Louis XIV, making the \\nKing feel insecure by throwing a lavish party that would show off Fouquet’s connections, \\ncultivated manner and charm. Thinking this move would make him an indispensabl e asset \\nto the king, Fouquet had actually offended his master who did not like the fact people were \\nmore charmed by his finance minister than by him. The King found a convenient excuse to \\nget rid of Fouquet.  \\n  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nGalileo was clever in observing this law by giving glory to his patrons. In order to solve his \\nperennial problem of funding, he dedicated his discovery of the moons of Jupiter to the \\nMedicis, since the royal symbol of the Medici family was the planet Jupit er. He then \\ncommissioned an emblem for them, with each moon representing one of the sons who \\nrevolved around the patriarch. The Medici family became his major patron, appointing him \\ntheir official court mathematician and philosopher, thereby giving him a m ore comfortable \\nlife and a steady salary.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Present your ideas in such a manner that they may be ascribed to your master, or \\ncould be viewed as an echo of your master’s thoughts.  \\n• If you are more intelligent than your master, act as if you are not.  \\n• Never take your position for granted.  \\n• Never let favors you receive go to your head.  \\n• Discreet flattery is much more powerful. Make it seem like you want to seek his \\nexpertise and advice.  \\n  \\n2. NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE \\nENEMIES.  \\n  \\n• Transgression of the Law.  \\nMichael III of the Byzantine Empire in the mid -ninth century A.D. placed too much trust \\nin his friend, Basilius. This was a young man who had once saved his life, and in return, \\nwas given all the privileges an emperor could bestow on a friend. Michael turn ed the \\npeasant Basilius into a sophisticated and educated courtier. Basilius later on became \\ngreedy for more wealth and power and had his former benefactor and best friend \\nMichael III murdered.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nEmperor Sung of China in 959 A.D. was able to turn all his enemies into loyal friends. \\nHe persuaded his generals to retire to a life of nobility and give up their dreams of \\ngrabbing his throne one day. He spared those who conspired against him, and was \\nable to win over enemies with his generosity.   \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Do not rely on friends. They will never be totally honest with you. They will not \\nopenly disagree with you in order to avoid arguments.  \\n• Enemies expect nothing so they will be surprised when you are generous.  \\n• An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend.  \\n• When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities she has kept hidden.  \\n• Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings.  \\n• Hiring friends will limit your power.  \\n• All working situations require a kind of distance between people.  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 3  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  • You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him.  \\n• An enemy at your heels keeps you sharp, alert, and focused.  \\n  \\n3. CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS.  \\n  \\n• Transgression of the Law.  \\nThe Marquis de Sevigne was young and inexperienced in the art of love. He confided \\nin the infamous courtesan of seventeenth -century France, Ninon de Lenclos, to instruct \\nhim on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a plan over a \\nnumber of weeks, where the Marquis would be appearing in public always surrounded \\nby beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expected to see him. He \\nwas supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased the jealousy of the \\nyoung count ess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day the Marquis, unable \\nto control his passion, broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to the countess that he \\nloved her. After this admission, the countess no longer found him interesting and \\navoided him .   \\n  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nOtto von Bismarck was a deputy in the Prussian parliament at a time when many fellow \\ndeputies thought it was possible to go to war against Austria and defeat it. Bismarck \\nknew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way to keep the war \\nat bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about the madness \\nof war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announced his real \\nintentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have won. \\nMost Pruss ians wanted to go to war at that moment and mistakenly believed their army \\nto be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity would have been \\ndoubted. By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and concealing his \\ntrue purpose, Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of prime minister. He \\nlater led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time, when he felt the \\nPrussian army was more capable.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off scent.  \\n• Use smoke screens (a poker face) to disguise your actions.  \\n• False sincerity is one powerful tool that will send your rivals on a wild goose chase.  \\n• Publicly declare your false intentions to give misleading signals.  \\n• A noble gesture can be a smoke screen to hide your true intentions.  \\n• Blend in and people will be less suspicious.  \\n  \\n  \\n4. ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY.  \\n  \\n• Transgression of the Law.  \\nCoriolanus was a great military hero of ancient Rome. People held him in awe, until he \\nopened his mouth. He spoke his mind, hardly able to control his arrogance and \\nboastfulness. He slandered and insulted people. The more speeches he made, the \\nless people respected him. He suffered the people’s wrath and was eventually \\nbanished from the city.   \\n  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nMasters of enigma Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp knew the power of saying less \\nand keeping people guessing. The less Duchamp talked about his work, the more it \\nwas talked about in the art circles. Andy Warhol recognized it was hard to talk people The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 4  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  into doing what you wanted, so when interviewed, he would give vague and ambiguous \\nanswers and let the interviewer find his own interpretation.   \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Saying less will keep you from saying something foolish or even dangerous.  \\n• Once the words are out you cannot take them back.  \\n• Keeping silent makes people reveal more about themselves. This is information \\nyou may be able to use against them later on.  \\n  \\n5. SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION – GUARD IT WITH YOUR  \\nLIFE.  \\n  \\n •  Observance of the Law  \\nDuring China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D.207 -265), General Liang was able to \\nfool his rival Sima Yi simply by letting his track record for being an undefeated leader \\nin battle do the work for him. Liang’s troops were far outnumbered by Sima Yi’s, yet he \\ndevised a clever last resort plan. Liang donned a Taoist robe and played the lute upon \\nthe wall of the city he was defending. His soldiers opened the gates and hid. When \\nSima Yi’s troops advanced upon the unguarded city, Yi recognized his opponent sitti ng \\nalone upon the wall. Fearing a trap, Sima Yi called his soldiers to retreat.  \\n  \\nP.T. Barnum was an expert at destroying his competitor’s reputation. He published \\nletters in newspapers, warning the public against buying his opponent’s stock. He was \\na master at poking mockery at the tactics of his rivals.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Sow doubt and spread rumors about your rival. Even if they vehemently deny it, \\npeople will still be wondering why they are so defensive.  \\n• Use humor or gentle mockery at your rival’s expense.  \\n• A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths without \\nyour having to spend much energy.  \\n• Never appear desperate in your self -defense against the slander of others.  \\n• Be careful not to go too far in attacking another’s reputation, it draws more attention \\nto your vengefulness than to the person you are slandering. Use subtler tactics like \\nsatire and ridicule.  \\n  \\n  \\n6. COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST.  \\n  \\n •  Observance of the Law  \\nP.T. Barnum learned about courting attention to his favor. Any form of publicity would \\nbenefit his entertainment business, no matter if it were bad publicity. He promoted his \\nshows of curiosities to audiences with all kinds of gimmicks. He would offer Free  Music \\nfor Millions, but hire bad musicians, so the crowd would end up buying tickets to the \\nshow so they could avoid the bands. He planted articles in newspapers and even sent \\nanonymous letters to keep his name in the limelight.  \\n  \\nMargaretha Zelle was able to use this law to make a name for herself as the mysterious \\nexotic dancer Mata Hari. It was rumored she was from India and danced in private \\nparties, in an Eastern manner never before seen in Europe. She would slowly discard \\nher veils and sarongs for the most prominent people in Paris who came to see her. The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 5  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  Many years later it would be discovered she was just a native of Holland and had \\nworked for the Germans as a spy.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Surround your name with the sensational and the scandalous.  \\n• Create an air of mystery.  \\n• It is better to be attacked and slandered than ignored.  \\n• Make yourself appear larger than life.  \\n• Any sort of notoriety will bring you power.  \\n  \\n7. GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE \\nCREDIT.  \\n• Transgression and Observance of the Law  \\nNicola Tesla was a Serbian scientist who never learned how this law was used against \\nhim time and again. His invention, the AC or alternating current system was associated \\nnot with his name but with that of George Westinghouse, who funded his research. \\nBoth Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse were ruthless businessmen who took \\ncredit for Tesla’s work. In the end, Tesla was living in poverty, while royalties for his \\nlife’s work went to Edison and Westinghouse. He accepted small sums as buy -outs for \\nhis wor k, when in reality his creations could have been worth millions. Even Marconi \\nmade use of a patent filed by Tesla in 1897. Tesla was the real “father of radio” but \\nreceived no money or credit for this invention.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Save time and energy by hiring others to do the work.  \\n• Your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered.  \\n• Borrow from history. Use the past and profit by others’ experience.  \\n• You can only exploit others’ talents if your position is unshakable.  \\n  \\n8. MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU – USE BAIT IF NECESSARY.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nNapoleon’s former foreign minister Talleyrand was master of this law. He knew \\nNapoleon loved the adoration of the masses, and this was the perfect bait to make the \\nformer ruler play into the hands of his opponents. In 1814 Napoleon was banished to \\na small island called Elba near Italy. Here he was given information that France would \\nembrace him again if he escaped. From Elba he was able to escape and march back \\ninto Paris with a small army. The people bowed to him, and soldiers changed sides to \\njoin him. Th e statesmen who had taken over his empire fled. Talleyrand watched as \\nhis plan unfolded. Napoleon ruled France again for a hundred days, but the country \\nwas bankrupt and could not sustain Napoleon’s wars any longer. Napoleon was \\nrecaptured at the Battle of  Waterloo and exiled to the barren island St. Helena, off the \\nwest coast of Africa. This was a much further place with no chance of escape, and was \\nmore to Talleyrand’s liking.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• For negotiations and meetings, it is wise to lure others into your territory, or a \\nterritory of your choice.  \\n• Once someone suspects you are manipulating him, it will be harder to control him. \\nMaking him come to you gives the illusion he is in control.  \\n• Most often the effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be \\nfrustrated by the traps you set for them.  \\n  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 6  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  9. WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nMichelangelo knew how to satisfy a patron while getting his way at the same time. Piero \\nSoderini, Florence’s mayor, commissioned him to transform a ruined piece of marble into \\na statue. Soderini visited the studio one day and commented that the nose of the  statue \\n(that of David with a sling in his hand) was too big. Michelangelo invited the mayor to climb \\nup a scaffolding, allowing him to look at the nose from a different perspective, while the \\nartist chiseled a bit, pretending to correct the size of the no se. The mayor was convinced \\nthe nose looked much better. Michelangelo succeeded in making Soderini think his \\ncomment had helped improve the work.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Demonstrate, do not explicate.  \\n• Arguing will only offend your superior.  \\n• Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly.  \\n• Choose your battles carefully.  \\n• Don’t bother demonstrating if time and experience will eventually teach the other \\nperson what you are trying to say. Save your energy and walk away.  \\n• No one can argue with a demonstrated proof.  \\n  \\n10. INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND THE UNLUCKY.  \\n• Transgression of the Law  \\nIn the 1840’s Marie Gilbert, better known as Lola Montez, came to Paris to become a \\ndancer and performer. She had many husbands, and caused the ruin of many a powerful \\nman. Because of her ambition to be a dancer she “accidentally” ran into Alexandre Dujari er, \\nthen the owner of France’s most popular newspaper and a drama critic himself. Although \\nstill legally married to an Englishman with whom she eloped at 19, Lola kept her status \\nsecret from all her husbands. Dujarier was shot dead defending her honor at a  duel against \\nanother drama critic. Lola went on to have several husbands, even causing King Ludwig of \\nBavaria to abdicate. She left another man who later fell into a deep depression, became a \\ndrunkard, and eventually died at a relatively young age. The ma n who published her \\nautobiography went bankrupt.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• In the game of power, the people you associate with are critical.  \\n• An infector can be recognized by the misfortune they draw on themselves, their \\nturbulent past, a long line of broken relationships, unstable careers, the very \\nintensity of their emotions, and the force of their character.  \\n• Gravitate towards prosperous, cheerful, and gregarious people.   \\n• Never associate with those who share your defects.  \\n  \\n  \\n11. LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU.  \\n •  Observance of the Law  \\nMichelangelo was able to keep his patron Pope Julius II dependent on him. When he and \\nthe pope quarreled over the building of the pope’s marble tomb, Michelangelo left Rome in \\ndisgust. The pope sought him out and begged the artist to stay. Michelangelo kne w he \\ncould always find another patron, but the pope knew he could not find another \\nMichelangelo.  \\n  \\nMichelangelo’s power was intensive, depending on one skill. Henry Kissinger’s power was \\nextensive. He was so involved in so many areas of the political structure that to remove The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 7  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  him would lead to chaos. The intensive form of power provides more freedom than the \\nextensive.  \\n  \\nMachiavelli said it is better to be feared than loved. Fear can be controlled; love, never.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Be the only one who can do what you do. Make the fate of those who hire you so \\nentwined with yours they cannot possibly get rid of you.  \\n• If you are ambitious, it is wiser to seek out weak masters with whom you can create \\na relationship of dependency.  \\n• Possess a talent or creative skill that sets you apart from the crowd.  \\n• By knowing other people’s secrets and holding information they wouldn’t want \\nmade public, you seal your fate with theirs.  \\n  \\n12. USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR \\nVICTIM.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nCount Victor Lustig promised Al Capone into giving him $50,000 on the terms that he would \\ndouble this investment in sixty days. Lustig kept the money untouched in a safety deposit \\nbox. After the sixty days were up, he apologized to Capone saying he had fai led to double \\nthe money. Capone expected either $100,000, or nothing, what he did not expect was an \\nhonest gesture of Lustig actually returning the $50,000. Al Capone was a man who lived in \\nconstant mistrust of people around him, and was so touched by the honest gesture he gave \\nLustig an extra $5,000.  \\n  \\nThe classic tale of the Fall of Troy is one example of hiding your ulterior motives within a \\ngift. The Trojan Horse was designed to hold soldiers that would attack the city of Troy and \\nrecapture Helen who had been taken away from the Greeks by Paris.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• The essence of deception is distraction. An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty \\nwill distract and disarm people and turn them into gullible children.  \\n• Give before you take.  \\n• Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt deceptiveness may sometimes \\ncover your tracks. If you have a history of deceit behind you, then play the rogue, \\nbe consistent and this will be interpreted as you simply being yourself. Your \\ndishonesty be comes an act of honesty.  \\n  \\n13. WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELF -INTEREST, \\nNEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nGenghis Khan was known for his greed and self -interest. When he conquered China, \\ninstead of slaughtering all the citizens, his adviser Yelu Ch’u -Ts’ai persuaded him to reap \\nthe benefits of their new territory by taxing its people. It was Ts’ai who also con vinced Khan \\nto spare the inhabitants of Kaifeng, where China’s finest craftsmen and engineers had fled. \\nTs’ai’s reasoning was Khan could use these people for his own benefit.  \\n  \\nMost people are very pragmatic, and when negotiating, do not bring up the need for \\ngratitude for what you have done for others in the past. These appeals will be ignored. \\nPragmatic people look towards the future, so it is best to emphasize how they will be nefit \\nfrom an alliance with you.   \\n  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 8  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  Wisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Understand the other person’s motivation.  \\n• See things their way and offer suggestions that will advance their cause.  \\n• For others who want to feel superior and do not want to appear selfish, appeal to \\ntheir need to display their charity in the public eye.    \\n14. POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nJoseph Duveen was the greatest art dealer of his time; from 1904 -1940 he singlehandedly \\nmonopolized the art -collecting market through his ingenious spying tactics. He would place \\nthe household employees of his potential clients on his own payroll. These sp ies would \\nprovide him valuable information as the tastes of his mark. He would arrange “accidental” \\nmeetings in elevators, leading his prey of wealthy patrons right into his trap. When clients \\ncame to visit his galleries, they found themselves surrounded b y works they would most \\nlikely buy.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Gather information at social events when people’s guards are down.  \\n• Use other people to give you the information you need.  \\n• Mislead others by giving out false information. Watch them react and base your \\nnext action on what you discover.  \\n  \\n15. CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nThe great Empress Wu of China was ruthless in her rise to power. She started out as a \\nconcubine of an emperor, but did not want to follow the traditional path: that of living the \\nrest of her life in a convent after the emperor’s death. She had seduced the emperor’s son \\nin the royal urinal and befriended his wife. Because of this Wu was able to get a royal edict \\nout of the convent. She returned to the harem, became pregnant, and murdered her own \\nbaby, knowing the prime suspect would be the jealous wife of th e new emperor. The wife \\nwas charged with murder and executed. Wu took her place and her new husband handed \\nover the reins of government to her, opting for a life of pleasure. Empress Wu ruled until \\nthe age of eighty when she was forced to abdicate. Through out her rule she eliminated son \\nafter son, anyone who would challenge her throne.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Show no mercy. Crush your rivals or else you will give them time to regroup and \\nplot their revenge.  \\n• Banish enemies or plot for the best time to render them harmless.  \\n• Leave your enemies no options.  \\n• Sometimes enemies will destroy themselves.   \\n• Thoughts of reconciliation will open you up to attack.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n16. USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nThis law is most appreciated in matters of seduction and love. Make yourself too available \\nand your presence will be taken for granted. In the Middle Ages, ladies played the game of \\npresence and absence by sending their knights off on long arduous quests. Sir Guillaume \\nde Balaun wanted to taste the joy of love after reconciliation, and twice he intentionally \\nmade himself scarce, withdrawing his affections from Madame Guillelma de Javiac. The \\nfirst time he drove his lover wild with grief, the second time she  became angry and cut him The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 9  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  off. When he wrote her begging to be let back into her favor, she allowed him back only on \\nthe condition he do penance for his cruelty.  \\n  \\nWith business, an early retirement at the height of your career will keep people holding you \\nin high regard, and waiting to see you make a comeback.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Create value through scarcity. Make yourself less accessible; otherwise the aura you \\nhave created around yourself will wear away.  \\n  \\n17. KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF \\nUNPREDICTABILITY.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nBobby Fischer beat chess champion Boris Spassky using this law of unpredictability. \\nSpassky’s method of playing chess was to base his strategy on the patterns he read in his \\nopponent’s moves. Fischer unnerved him by arriving late for the first two tourname nts, even \\nletting a match get forfeited. On the third game he made moves that were so \\nuncharacteristic and bold Spassky was thrown off balance. Fourteen games later Spassky \\nclaimed Fischer was probably putting drugs in the orange juice they drank while pla ying. \\nSpassky resigned a few months later and never recovered from his defeat.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• A person of power instills fear by deliberately unsettling those around him to keep \\nthe initiative on his side.  \\n• Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.  \\n  \\n18. DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF – \\nISOLATION IS DANGEROUS.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nKing Louis XIV recognized the importance of always keeping his eyes and ears on \\neveryone and everything around him. He built a palace in Versailles where all the nobility \\ncould keep apartments near to his. He knew that if he were to isolate himself for one  \\nmoment, conspiracies would rise behind his back. The daily activities all revolved around \\nthe king, leaving no one unnoticed, hundreds of visitors and attendants were always \\npresent. There was not very much privacy for the king and he preferred this life to one of \\nisolation.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• A fortress may be impregnable, but everyone knows you are there and it may easily \\nturn into a prison.   \\n• Power depends on social interaction and circulation.   \\n• Isolation is deadly for the creative arts. Shakespeare was always producing plays for \\nthe masses. He was in constant touch with reality and what people wanted.   \\n• Mobility and social contact protects you from plotters.   \\n  \\n19. KNOW WHO YOU’RE DEALING WITH – DO NOT OFFEND THE \\nWRONG PERSON.  \\n• Transgression of the Law  \\nIn the early thirteenth century, Muhammad the Shah of Khwarezm made the grave mistake \\nin offending a new tribal leader who was emerging in the east. His name was Genghis \\nKhan. Khan offered to share the Silk Route with Muhammad, sending ambassadors to \\nforge  a deal. After his ambassadors were beheaded, Genghis Khan declared war.

Muhammad fled, \\nand the Silk Route fell into the hands of Genghis Khan.  \\n  \\nLearn to distinguish from opponent, sucker, and victim. The five difficult and sometimes \\ndangerous marks are: the arrogant and proud, the hopelessly insecure, the suspicious, the \\nserpent with a long memory, and the plain, unassuming, unintelligent man.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Measure up your opponent, but never rely on instinct. Do some research on concrete \\nfacts about that person’s character and history.   \\n• Never trust appearances.   \\n  \\n20. DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nQueen Elizabeth I managed to avoid the trap of marriage and war, by dangling the \\npossibility of marriage to all who courted her. She forged alliances with the countries these \\nsuitors came from, all for the benefit of England. By keeping her independence ab ove all, \\nElizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• By refusing to commit, but allowing yourself to be courted, you become powerful \\nbecause you are ungraspable.   \\n• As your reputation for independence grows, more people will desire you and want to \\nconquer you.   \\n• Politely decline. You cannot allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone.   \\n• Seek promises from both sides, so no matter what the outcome of an election or battle, \\nyour position is secure.   \\n• Observe quarreling parties and stay neutral but supportive to both sides. Gain power \\nas a mediator.   \\n• You may commit to one to prove you are capable of attachment, but be emotionally \\nuninvolved. Preserve the unspoken option of being able to leave anytime and reclaim \\nyour freedom. The friends you made while being courted will help you jump ship.   \\n  \\n21. PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER – SEEM DUMBER THAN \\nYOUR MARK.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nIn what was the biggest diamond scam of the century, prospectors Philip Arnold and John \\nSlack fooled the biggest financiers of the time, Asbury Harpending, Baron Rothschild, and \\nWilliam Ralston into investing their millions in a fake mine site. The two men  played up their \\nsmall town, scruffy image; convincing the sophisticated tycoons that they would easily be \\nbought out for their discovery of the mines. In the end, after the legal pay -off was made to \\nthe two men, the investors realized the mine had been sa lted with uncut gems by Arnold \\nand Slack. Since all the business had been legal, and experts had inspected the mines, \\nthere was no way to go after the two men.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Intelligence is an important part of people’s vanity. Subliminally reassure your opponent \\nof his superiority.   \\n• Playing naïve lets you see opportunities to deceive others.   \\n  \\n22. USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO \\nPOWER.  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 11  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  • Observance of the Law  \\nGerman writer Bertolt Brecht was called to appear before the US Congress’s House of Un -\\nAmerican Activities Committee during the heyday of the Communist investigations. Unlike \\nhis companions in the Hollywood 19, (other producers, directors and writers who e spoused \\ncommunism in their scripts) he chose to be respectful to the committee. Subtly he mocked \\nthem by offering vague but polite answers, used an interpreter to run circles around them \\nwhen asked about the lines from his poems, and was summarily dismisse d. He was free \\nto leave America and continue writing as he pleased, while his friends in Hollywood lost \\nvaluable working years as a result of being blacklisted.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Do not fight aggression with aggression. Put your opponent off -guard by yielding, and \\nin effect have more control over the situation.   \\n• Surrender is a way of mocking your enemies.   \\n• Surrender disguises your real motives and allows time to plan your next move.   \\n  \\n23. CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES.  \\n• Observance of the Law  \\nThe Rothschild banking family concentrated its wealth within a very tight -knit structure. Five \\nbrothers each controlled a part of the empire from Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Naples, to \\nLondon. They established themselves as a powerful force in business and p olitics, keeping \\nthe secrets of the family business by exchanging internal communications only in code or \\nFrankfurt Yiddish. Family policy ruled and their children intermarried, all of them first \\ncousins.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Single -mindedness of purpose and total concentration on one goal will overwhelm the \\nenemy every time.   \\n• A single patron appreciates your loyalty and becomes dependent on your services.  \\n• In the arts, being too single -minded can make you an intolerable bore.   \\n  \\n24. PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Avoid ostentation. Talk less about yourself. Modesty is generally preferable.  \\n• Practice nonchalance. All your hard work must come off as effortless.  \\n• Be frugal with flattery.   \\n• Arrange to be noticed.  \\n• Alter your style and language according to the person you are dealing with.  \\n• Never be the bearer of bad news.  \\n• Never affect friendliness and intimacy with your master.  \\n• Never criticize those above you directly.  \\n• Be frugal in asking those above you for favors.  \\n• Never joke about appearances or taste.  \\n• Do not be the court cynic.  \\n• Be self -observant.  \\n• Master your emotions.  \\n• Fit the spirit of the times.  \\n• Be a source of pleasure.  \\n  \\n25. RE-CREATE YOURSELF.  \\nObservance of the Law  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 12  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  Julius Caesar always incorporated drama and theatrics in his speeches and daily \\nappearances. He was a great public showman, timing his entrances and exits, sponsoring \\nextravagant spectacles, gladiator shows and theatrical events. The masses loved him, but \\nhis rivals feared him.  \\n  \\nAurore Dupin Dudevant left her husband and family in the provinces to become a writer in \\nParis, something unheard of and almost impossible for a woman to do in 1831. For the \\npublication of her novel Indiana , she assumed the pseudonym George Sand. She dressed \\nin men’s breeches, smoked cigars, and expressed herself in conversation like a man. She \\neven carried on affairs with the most famous artists of Europe - Musset, Liszt, and Chopin \\n- living with freedom an d independence unlike any other female writer befo re her.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Control your appearances and emotions. Play sincere, but not necessarily be sincere.   \\n• Create a memorable character. Do not limit yourself to the role society assigns to you.   \\n  \\n26. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN.  \\nObservance of the Law:  \\nCleopatra was always able to get people to do her bidding without them realizing she was \\nmanipulating them.  She was able to charm Julius Caesar into restoring her to the throne \\nof Egypt, and playing her siblings against each other. Marc Antony was seduced  by her, \\nand had her younger sister Arsinoe executed, ridding Cleopatra of any threats to her place \\nas Queen. Wisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Conceal your mistakes. Your good name and reputation depends more on what you \\nconceal than on what you reveal.   \\n• Always have a convenient scapegoat.   \\n• Never do the dirty work yourself.   \\n  \\n27. PLAY ON PEOPLE’S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULT -LIKE \\nFOLLOWING.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Keep it simple; keep it vague. Create new words for vague concepts.   \\n• Emphasize the visual and sensual over the intellectual.   \\n• Borrow the forms of organized religion to structure the group. Create rituals. Use names \\nand ranks and titles. Ask them to make sacrifices and give alms. Act like a guru or a \\nprophet.   \\n• Disguise your source of income.   \\n• Set up an us -versus -them dynamic. Keep followers united by identifying outsiders as a \\ndevious enemy.   \\n• The tendency to doubt and reason is broken down when we join a group.   \\n  \\n28. ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS.  \\nIvan the Terrible waited five years before executing his first major bold move. After years of \\npersecution by the Shuisky family, the poisoning of his mother Helena, and the banishment \\nof his only friend Vorontsov, the thirteen year -old Ivan invited his ri val Prince Andrei Shuisky \\ninto his room. No one feared the young boy and the boyars often ridiculed him. When the \\nguards were suddenly ordered to seize Prince Andrei and execute him, no one saw it \\ncoming. This one swift and bold act secured Ivan’s power fo r decades to come.  \\n  \\nIvan initially lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited until he had won \\nover the palace guards to his side. They had come to hate the cruelty of the Shuiskys over \\nthe years, and the time was at hand to strike boldly and swiftly.  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 13  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com    \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• The bolder the lie, the better.   \\n• Lions circle the hesitant prey.   \\n• Boldness strikes fear; Fear creates authority.   \\n• Going halfway digs the deeper grave. Do not negotiate if you opponent will more likely \\ntake the opportunity to destroy you.   \\n• Hesitation creates gaps. Boldness obliterates them. Move swiftly and surely.   \\n• Audacity separates you from the herd.   \\n  \\n29. PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Take into account all possible obstacles and circumstances that may prevent you from \\nachieving your goal, and plan how you will overcome them.   \\n• When you see several steps ahead, you will no longer need to improvise along the \\nway, and risk deviating from your plan.   \\n• Prepare alternatives and be open to adapt new routes to your goal.   \\n    \\n30. MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS.  \\nObservance of the Law:  \\nSen no Rikyu was an important tea master and adviser on aesthetic and political matters \\nto the Emperor Hideyoshi. He despised hosts who looked like they were trying to hard.  \\nCha-no-yu, or the Japanese tea ceremony, is an art form, from the preparation to the \\nserving; the whole process must look natural and easy. Accidental grace and beauty were \\nRikyu’s specialty. On the night before the Emperor was to visit him for a tea ceremony, he \\nartfully laid cushions in the snow on each stepping -stone to his house. I n the morning, he \\nremoved the cushions revealing the pattern of the stepping -stones like a perfect mold within \\nthe snow. This was just one of Rikyu’s clever aesthetic tricks which impressed the Emperor, \\nnever calling attention to the work gone into it, but  implying a polite gesture in itself.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• What imitates nature by appearing effortless and natural approximates nature’s power.   \\n• Never show your work until it is finished. When people see the effort and time it takes \\nto make it, and if they witness a work -in-progress, the magic of the finished piece is \\nspoiled.   \\n  \\n31. CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS \\nYOU DEAL.  \\nObservance of the Law:  \\nSeventeenth -century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos needed to devise a way of \\nmaintaining her lifestyle while having the freedom no woman could achieve in her day. She \\ngave her lovers and suitors three choices, a payeur would pay for her services, but sh e \\nwould only sleep with him when she liked, a martyr would not have to pay, and be part of \\nher harem of men, and from the martyrs she would choose a favori, or one man to whom \\nshe would abandon herself to totally until she was tired of him. The payeurs wer e able to \\nfinance her needs while she enjoyed complete freedom, independence, and variety from \\nher lovers. She had the equality to men no married woman of the time could possess.   \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Make people your puppets and give them options to let them feel they have control. \\nForce them to choose between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your \\npurpose.   The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 14  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  • Present options but color the one you prefer as the best solution.   \\n• Force the resister into “choosing” to do what you want by appearing to advocate the \\nopposite.   \\n• Alter the playing field so the only options available are the ones you offer.  • Shrinking \\noptions force people to buy in now or else the goods won’t be available tomorrow.   \\n• The weak man must be propelled into action through fear and terror.  • Involving your \\nvictim in your scheme with the threat of their exposure later will keep them tied to you. \\nThey cannot expose you because they will be found out as well.   \\n• Use the horns of a dilemma: whichever way they choose, there is no escape.   \\n  \\n32. PLAY TO PEOPLE’S FANTASIES.  \\nObservance of the Law:  \\nIn the 1700s, a mysterious stranger named George Psalmanazar came to fame with his \\nbooks and lectures on the language, culture and history of the island of Formosa (now \\nTaiwan).  After his death, it was revealed that he was in fact a Frenchman with a rich \\nimagination who played on the British need for the exotic and strange. He had invented \\neverything he had professed to be an expert on, having capitalized on it with best -selling \\nbooks and having been a favorite guest at many royal dinners.  \\n  \\nAbraham Lincoln created an image of himself as the homespun country lawyer with a \\nbeard. He played to the fantasy of the common man’s president.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• People need a fantasy to escape from the humdrum of everyday life. The more vague \\nand exotic, the more captivating.   \\n• Promise a pot of gold and instant gratification, rather than a gradual improvement \\nthrough hard work.   \\n• Keep your distance so the fantasy remains intact.   \\n  \\n33. DISCOVER EACH MAN’S THUMBSCREW.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Every person has a weakness or insecurity you can use to your advantage.   \\n• Train yourself to probe for weaknesses in everyday conversation.   \\n• Find the childhood need that went unfulfilled, supply it, and your victim will be unable \\nto resist you.   \\n• People’s weaknesses are the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you. The shy \\nperson is actually dying for attention; a prude may be hiding a lascivious soul, etc.   \\n• Find the weak link or the one person in a group who will bend under pressure.   \\n• Feed on uncontrollable emotions or motive – paranoia, lust, greed, vanity, or hatred.   \\n• When searching for suckers, always look for the unhappy, insecure and dissatisfied.   \\n  \\n34. BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE \\nTREATED LIKE ONE.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. Exude confidence and the \\nfeeling you were destined for greatness.   \\n• Do not confuse regal bearing with arrogance.   \\n• Dignity is the mask you assume under difficult circumstances. Act like nothing can \\naffect you and you have all the time in the world to respond.   \\n• Set your price high and do not waver.   The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 15  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  • Deal with the highest person in the building.   \\n• A gift is an equalizer. You do not beg but ask for help in a dignified way.   \\n  \\n35. MASTER THE ART OF TIMING.  \\nTime as a human -made concept  \\nThere are three kinds of time we deal with when building power: the Long Time is the years -\\nlong period of waiting for the right opportunity while creating a strong foundation or base to \\nwork from. Forced Time is upsetting the timing of others and setting t heir deadlines for \\nthem. The opponent will be more likely to make mistakes because of the need to hurry, or \\nin the case of business, will be forced to buy whatever you offer because the time to make \\na decision is limited. End Time is when we execute a plan  with speed and absolutely no \\nhesitation.  \\n  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Never look as though you are in a hurry. It betrays a lack of control.  • Learn to \\nstand back and be patient. Strike only when the time is right.   \\n• Anticipate events and work with the spirit of the times.  \\n• Recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean running with them.  \\n  \\n36. DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE \\nBEST REVENGE.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him. The less interest you \\nshow, the more superior you seem.  \\n• Remember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily choose to consider \\nthe matter trivial and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful move.  \\n• If it is impossible to ignore, then secretly get rid of it. Sometimes threats just go away by \\nthemselves.  \\n  \\n37. CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Never neglect the way you arrange things visually.  • Associate yourself with colors, \\nimages and symbols that communicate strong messages.   \\n• People are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things, the grand, and \\nthe spectacular, what is larger than life.  \\n  \\n38. THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior and \\nmouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them.   \\n• Put on the mask appropriate to the group you are joining.   \\n  \\n39. STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell: • Anger and emotion are strategically unproductive. Make your \\nenemies angry but stay calm yourself.   \\n• Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous.   \\n• Nothing in the game of power is personal.  \\n• An occasional outburst may be powerful, but use anger too often and it loses its power.  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 16  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  40. DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• By paying your own way you stay free of gratitude. What is offered for free normally \\nhas a hidden obligation.   \\n• Generosity is a sign of power. Most powerful people spend freely and are not misers.   \\n• Use money as a way to give pleasure to others and win them over.   \\n  \\n41. AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN’S SHOES.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Choose a different path and personal style if you are the daughter or son of a great \\nperson. You will forever be in your predecessor’s shadow unless you find a way to \\nshine on your own.   \\n• Only after the father figure has been done away with will there be space to establish a \\nnew order.   \\n• Do not become complacent once you reach success and security. Prosperity makes \\nus lazy. Writers like Tennessee Williams and Fyodor Dostoyevsky preferred the \\nstruggle to security; the way poverty or emotional difficulties pushed them to create \\ngood work.   \\n  \\n42. STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Within any group, trouble can be traced to a single source, the unhappy, chronically \\nunsatisfied one who stirs up dissension and infects the group. Recognize \\ntroublemakers by their complaining nature. Separate him from the group.  \\n• In every group power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people. Human \\nnature shows people will orbit around a single strong personality.  \\n  \\n43. WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS.  \\nTransgression of the Law  \\nMarie -Antoinette was put to death by guillotine in 1793, after the French monarchy was \\nended by the revolution. Not a single soul came to her defense. Marie -Antoinette brought \\nupon herself the hatred of all. Her jewelry, wardrobe, hair, and masked balls, h er lavish \\nlifestyle had been more important to her than the needs of her people.  \\n   \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Aim at the primary emotions: love, hate, and jealousy. Be alert to people’s \\nindividual psychologies and their basic emotional responses.  \\n• Maintain a stable of writers, artists, or intellectuals who are very good at appealing \\nto people’s hearts and minds.  \\n  \\n44. DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• The neutralizing effect: Do what your enemies do, follow their actions and they will \\nnot see what you are up to. When you mirror them, if mocks and humiliates them. \\nMimicry infuriates.  \\n• The Shadow effect: Shadow your opponents’ every move, gather information, and \\ngain insight to their routines and habits without them seeing you.  \\n• The Mirror effect: Show you understand by reflecting their innermost feelings.  \\n• The Moral effect: Teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own \\nmedicine.  The 48 Laws Of Power    Page 17  \\nwww.bizsum.com   © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com  • The Hallucinatory effect: offer a perfect copy of an object, place or person and see \\nhow people take the bait.  \\n  \\n45. PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO \\nMUCH AT ONCE.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Make change and reform seem like a gentle improvement on the past. People are \\ncreatures of habit and the sudden change will cause some to rebel.  \\n• Disguise change by dressing it in tradition.  \\n  \\n46. NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• Never underestimate the power of envy. Occasionally reveal a weakness, defect, \\nor anxiety, or find new friends. It is the people in your own circle of peers who will \\nbe the first to envy your success.  \\n• Envy is often a problem for people who have great natural talent. You may think \\nyou are charming people with your natural talent when in fact they are coming to \\nhate you for it.  \\n• To deflect envy, employ a display of weakness, or a harmless vice.  \\n• Envy is disguised sometimes as excessive praise, or slander and criticism. Win \\nyour revenge by ignoring the envious.  \\n• Reversal: Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding \\nyour perfection, make it obvious. Make every triumph an opportunity to make the \\nenvious squirm.  \\n  \\n47. DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN VICTORY, LEARN \\nWHEN TO STOP.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\n• The powerful know that the essence of strategy is controlling what comes next.  \\n• There is no better time to stop and walk away than after a victory.  \\n  \\n48. ASSUME FORMLESSNESS.  \\nWisdom in a nutshell:  \\nAccept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. Be as fluid and formless as water, \\nadapting and moving with change naturally. The powerful are creative in expressing \\nsomething new. This feminine, formless style of ruling as practiced by Elizab eth of England \\nand Catherine of Russia, allows flexibility and makes subjects feel less coerced. Play the \\nchameleon but break your enemy from the inside. Morph and adapt but keep your long -\\nterm strategy in mind at all times.   \\n  '"
